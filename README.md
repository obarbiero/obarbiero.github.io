# Omar's Website

I have modified the Jekyll theme [Jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) to build this website. 

Follow the official Jekyll guide to install [Jekyll on Windows](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/windows/).
Follow the official Jekyll guide to install [Jekyll on MacOS](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/macos/). The only issue I had was being able to "unlock" ~/.zshrc. Find it, right-click, get info, click on bottom right lock symbol.

Add any `gems` on the file *config.yml* and then run `bundle install` before `jekyll serve`. Don't follow package guides.
