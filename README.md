# Omar's Website

I have modified the Jekyll theme [Jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) to build this website. 

I followed the official Jekyll guide to install [Jekyll on Windows](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/windows/).

Add any `gems` on the file *config.yml* and then run `bundle install` before `jekyll serve`. Don't follow package guides.
