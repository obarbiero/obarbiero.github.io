title: Dealer Risk Limit and Currency Returns
subtitle: With Falk Brauning, Gustavo Joaquim, and Hillary Stein
filename: FXdealerlimits.pdf
blurb: Granular-identified desk risk limit shocks of global FX dealers lead to turnover and exposure reduction, increased currency returns and spread increase. The evidence is in line with a model of dealers market segmentation.
abstract: We leverage supervisory micro data to uncover the role of global banks' risk limits in drivign exchange rate dynamics. Consistent with a model of currency intermediation under risk constraints, shocks to dealers' risk limits lead to price and quantity adjustments in the foreign exchange market. We show that dealers adjust their net exposure and increase spread in response to granular-identified limit shocks, leading to lower turnover and an adjustment in currency returns. The exchange rate adjustment is stronger when interacted with shifts in net dollar demadn, as predicted by theory, and triggers deviations from coverred and uncovered interest parity.
