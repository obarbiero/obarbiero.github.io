title: The Valuation Effects of Trade
subtitle: Job Market Paper
filename: VET.pdf
blurb: ​Selling and buying goods with prices specified in dollars generates currency mismatch on French firms' balance sheets. Exporters can deal with it. Investments and employment of small domestic-oriented firms remain highly exposed to merchandise valuations.
abstract: This paper estimates the cash flow effects of currency mismatches generated by foreign-priced operations of French manufacturers. The value of transactions invoiced in foreign currencies is twice as sensitive to exchange rates as the value of transactions invoiced in the domestic currency. I aggregate foreign-priced operations to the firm level to build a shift-share measure of invoice currency mismatch. This measure outperforms any trade-weighted effective exchange rate index at explaining cash flows of trading firms. Large firms absorb valuation shocks in their balance sheet and small exporters partially hedge their dollar-priced exports with dollar-priced imports. Investment and payroll of small domestic-oriented firms are sensitive to invoice currency valuations.  These results show how trade value sensitivities to currency fluctuations can coexist with the evidence of disconnect between exchange rates and real macroeconomic fundamentals.
