title: The Valuation Effects of Trade
subtitle: Job Market Paper
blurb: ​Selling and buying goods with prices specified in dollars generates currency mismatch on French firms' balance sheets. Large firms can deal with it. Small firms' investments and employment decisions remain exposed to valuations of their dollar-priced operations.

This paper estimates the cash flow effects of currency mismatches generated by foreign-priced operations of French manufacturers. My results show how large trade value sensitivities to currency fluctuations coexist with the evidence of disconnect between exchange rates and real macroeconomic fundamentals. I find that the value of transactions invoiced in foreign currencies is twice as sensitive to exchange rates as the value of transactions invoiced in the domestic currency. Movements in nominal valuations drives this result, as opposed to real demand responses. I aggregate pricing choices to the firm level to build a shift-share measure of invoice currency mismatch. My measure outperforms any trade-weighted effective exchange rate index at explaining cash flows of trading firms. However, virtually all investment and payroll sensitivity to foreign-pricing mismatch come from small domestic-oriented firms. The real macroeconomic effects are limited because large traders are liquid and small exporters partially hedge their dollar-priced exports with dollar-priced imports.
