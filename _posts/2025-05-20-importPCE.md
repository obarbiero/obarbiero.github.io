blurb: We develop a new methodology for tracing out how border price increases pass through into US consumer prices under different markup assumptions. We find full pass-through of 2018 tariffs into consumer prices.
abstract: We develop a new methodology for tracing out how border price increases pass through into US consumer prices. We build a model with a network structure, markups, and domestic retailers, from which we map each model object to publicly-available US data. We calculate import price sensitivities by expenditure category, which lends itself to several applications. First, we build a consumption-weighted import price index that improves prediction of consumer prices. Second, we predict the partial-equilibrium effects of various tariff scenarios and use these predictions to show that the 2018 US tariffs fully passed through to consumer prices.
