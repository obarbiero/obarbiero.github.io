blurb: We develop a new methodology for tracing out how border price increases pass through into US consumer prices under different markup assumptions. We find full pass-through of tariffs into consumer prices.
abstract: We develop a new methodology for tracing out how border price increases may pass through into US consumer prices. This methodology builds upon a static open economy model with a network structure, markups, and domestic retailers, from which we carefully map each model object to publicly-available US data, including input-output tables and information on industry and retailer margins. We calculate import price sensitivities by expenditure category, which lends itself to a few applications. First, we build a consumption-weighted import price index that improves consumer prices prediction. Second, we predict the partial-equilibrium effects of various tariff scenarios. An additional 10 percent tariff on the rest of the world would prompt a 0.78 to 1.34 percentage point increase in inflation, with significant heterogeneity by country. Finally, we show full pass-through to consumer prices of the 2018 tariffs.
